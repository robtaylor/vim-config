# Rob's vimrc

This is Rob's vimrc, it is built on pathogen and git submodules, based of Dannielle Madeley's <https://github.com/danni/vim-config>

Includes config obtained many years ago from Grahame Bowland.

Feel free to clone as .vim and then symlink .vim/vimrc -> .vimrc

## Usage

Start of day:

    git submodule update --init --recursive


To add a new bundle, simply:
 
    git submodule add PATH bundle/MODULE_NAME.
